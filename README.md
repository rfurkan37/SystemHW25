   cd SystemHW25
   ```
2. Navigate to the relevant assignment folder and follow the instructions in its README or Makefile.

## Assignments Overview

### Homework 1 (hw1/)
A comprehensive file management utility written in C that provides essential file and directory operations with built-in logging capabilities and file locking mechanisms. Features include directory creation/deletion, file operations, directory listing with extension filtering, process management, and thread-safe operations using `flock()`.

### Homework 2 (hw2/)
An inter-process communication program using named pipes (FIFOs), signal handling, and daemon processes. Demonstrates advanced system programming concepts including multi-process architecture, FIFO communication, proper signal handling, zombie process prevention, and background daemon logging.

### Homework 3 (hw3/)
Advanced system programming assignment focusing on core system concepts. Implementation details available in the main source file and accompanying report.

### Homework 4 (hw4/)
Buffer implementation project with logging capabilities. Includes buffer management, system programming concepts, and comprehensive logging functionality for debugging and monitoring.

### Midterm (midterm/)
Bank client-server simulation with automated testing. Features client-server architecture, teller processes, concurrency handling, comprehensive test suites including memory leak detection, and various test cases for error handling and stress testing.

### Final Project (final/)
Complete client-server chat application with advanced features including room management, file transfer capabilities, logging system, and multi-client support. Includes separate client and server implementations with shared utilities and automated launch scripts.

## Build & Run

Most assignments can be built using `make` or the provided build scripts. For example:

```sh
cd hw1
make
./main
```

Refer to each subfolder's README.md for specific build and run instructions.
