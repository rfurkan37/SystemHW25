# Multi-threaded Chat and File Server Implementation Summary

## Project Overview
This project implements a complete multi-threaded distributed chat and file server system in C, supporting up to 15 concurrent clients with room-based chat, private messaging, file transfer capabilities, and graceful shutdown handling.

## Architecture

### Server Components
- **Main Thread**: Handles server initialization, signal handling, and client acceptance
- **Client Handler Threads**: One thread per connected client for message processing
- **File Transfer Worker**: Dedicated thread for managing file transfer queue
- **Thread-Safe Logging**: Centralized logging with mutex protection

### Threading Model
- **Main server thread**: Accepts new connections and spawns client threads
- **Client threads**: Handle individual client communication and commands
- **File transfer thread**: Processes file transfer requests from a queue
- **Signal handling**: Graceful shutdown on SIGINT with proper cleanup

### Synchronization Mechanisms
- **Mutexes**: Protect shared resources (client list, rooms, file queue, logging)
- **Semaphores**: Control file transfer slots (max 3 concurrent transfers)
- **Condition Variables**: Signal file transfer worker when new requests arrive

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Multi-threaded Server Architecture ✅
- Main thread for accepting connections
- Individual threads for each client (max 15)
- Dedicated file transfer worker thread
- Proper thread synchronization and cleanup

### 2. Room-based Chat System ✅
- Dynamic room creation when users join
- Room-specific message broadcasting
- Users can switch between rooms
- Automatic room cleanup when empty

### 3. Private Messaging (Whisper) ✅
- Direct user-to-user messaging
- Whisper command: `/whisper <username> <message>`
- Validation of target user existence

### 4. File Transfer System ✅
- Queue-based file transfer management
- Support for .txt, .pdf, .jpg, .png files (max 3MB)
- Chunked transfer (4KB chunks)
- Semaphore-controlled concurrent transfers (max 3)

### 5. Input Validation ✅
- Alphanumeric usernames (max 16 characters)
- Room names (max 32 characters)
- File type and size restrictions
- Duplicate username prevention

### 6. Thread-safe Logging ✅
- Timestamped log entries
- Mutex-protected log file access
- Comprehensive activity logging
- Connection/disconnection tracking

### 7. Graceful Shutdown ✅
- SIGINT signal handling
- Client notification on server shutdown
- Proper resource cleanup
- Thread termination management

## Technical Implementation Details

### Message Protocol
```c
typedef struct {
    message_type_t type;
    char sender[MAX_USERNAME_LEN + 1];
    char room[MAX_ROOM_NAME_LEN + 1];
    char content[MAX_MESSAGE_LEN + 1];
    char filename[MAX_FILENAME_LEN + 1];
    size_t file_size;
    time_t timestamp;
} message_t;
```

### Supported Commands
- `/join <room>` - Join or create a room
- `/whisper <user> <message>` - Send private message
- `/send <filename>` - Send file to current room
- `/list` - List users in current room
- `/rooms` - List all active rooms
- `/help` - Show available commands
- `/quit` - Disconnect from server

### File Transfer Process
1. Client requests file transfer with `/send <filename>`
2. Server validates file (type, size, existence)
3. Request added to file transfer queue
4. File transfer worker processes queue with semaphore control
5. File data sent in 4KB chunks to all room members

## Testing and Validation

### Automated Test Suite
The project includes comprehensive automated testing:

#### Original Test Results (test_runner.sh)
- ✅ Server startup and initialization
- ⚠️ Client connections (immediate disconnection due to stdin EOF)
- ✅ Duplicate username handling
- ✅ Server capacity limits
- ✅ Invalid input rejection
- ✅ Graceful shutdown
- ✅ Log file creation and verification

#### Improved Test Results (test_runner_improved.sh)
- ✅ Server startup and initialization
- ✅ Single client persistent connection
- ✅ Multiple concurrent connections (5/5 clients)
- ✅ Duplicate username handling
- ✅ Invalid input rejection
- ✅ Room join and broadcast functionality
- ✅ Graceful server shutdown with client notification
- ✅ Log file creation with 162+ entries

### Key Testing Improvements
1. **Fixed stdin EOF Issue**: Used named pipes to maintain persistent client connections
2. **Better Log Analysis**: Analyzed server logs to verify functionality
3. **Realistic Test Scenarios**: Clients stay connected long enough to test features
4. **Enhanced Validation**: Checked both server logs and client output

### Manual Testing Capabilities
- `manual_test_demo.sh`: Demonstrates full chat functionality with multiple clients
- Interactive testing with real terminal windows
- Room switching, broadcasting, and whisper functionality
- Visual demonstration of all features working together

## Performance Characteristics
- **Concurrent Clients**: Up to 15 simultaneous connections
- **File Transfer**: Max 3 concurrent transfers, 3MB file size limit
- **Memory Management**: Proper allocation/deallocation, no memory leaks
- **Thread Safety**: All shared resources properly synchronized
- **Scalability**: Efficient resource usage with bounded limits

## Error Handling
- Connection failures and network errors
- Invalid user input and commands
- File transfer errors and validation
- Resource exhaustion (max clients, file size)
- Graceful degradation on errors

## Security Considerations
- Input validation and sanitization
- File type restrictions
- Size limits to prevent DoS
- Username uniqueness enforcement
- Proper resource cleanup

## Build and Deployment
```bash
# Compile the project
make

./chatserver <port>

# Run client
./chatclient <server_ip> <port>

# Run automated tests
