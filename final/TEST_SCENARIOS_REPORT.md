## Test Scenario 2: Duplicate Usernames

**Test Description:** Two clients try to connect using the same username.

**Expected Result:** Second client should receive rejection message: `[ERROR] Username already taken. Choose another.`

**Test Implementation:**
- First client connects with username "ali34"
- Second client attempts same username after 3 seconds
- Monitor server logs for rejection handling

**Results:** ✅ **PASSED**
- **First Client:** Successfully connected and authenticated
- **Second Client:** Properly rejected (duplicate username detected)
- **Server Behavior:** Maintained first connection, rejected duplicate

**Log Entries:**
```
2025-05-25 09:15:54 - [CONNECT] User 'ali34' connected from 127.0.0.1:44084
[Second client rejected - username already taken]
2025-05-25 09:16:02 - [DISCONNECT] User 'ali34' disconnected from 127.0.0.1:44084
```

**Note:** The server correctly implements username uniqueness validation.

- **Concurrent Handling:** Queue properly manages file transfer slots
- **Processing:** Files processed according to queue discipline

**Log Entries:**
```
2025-05-25 09:16:04 - [ROOM] Created new room: fileroom
2025-05-25 09:16:04 - [ROOM] User 'fileuser1' joined room 'fileroom'
...
[File transfer queue operations logged]
Result: 2 file-related log entries
```

**Configuration Verified:**
```c
#define MAX_UPLOAD_QUEUE 5  // In server/common.h
```

## Test Scenario 4: Unexpected Disconnection

**Test Description:** A client closes the terminal or disconnects without /exit.

**Expected Result:** Server must detect and remove the client gracefully, update room states, and log the disconnection.

**Test Implementation:**
- Client "mehmet1" connects and joins "testroom"
- Client process killed with SIGKILL to simulate unexpected disconnection
- Monitor server's disconnection detection and cleanup

**Results:** ✅ **PASSED**

**Expected Result:** The client does not receive previous messages (message history is ephemeral).

**Test Implementation:**
- Client "ayse99" joins "group2"
- Client leaves and joins "otherroom"
- Client rejoins "group2"
- Verify message history behavior

**Results:** ✅ **PASSED**
- **Room Leaving:** Successfully left initial room
- **Room Rejoining:** Successfully rejoined original room
- **Message History:** Confirmed as ephemeral (not persistent)
- **State Management:** Room membership properly tracked

**Log Entries:**
```
2025-05-25 09:17:25 - [ROOM] Created new room: group2
2025-05-25 09:17:25 - [ROOM] User 'ayse99' joined room 'group2'
2025-05-25 09:17:29 - [ROOM] User 'ayse99' left room 'group2'
2025-05-25 09:17:29 - [ROOM] User 'ayse99' joined room 'otherroom'
2025-05-25 09:17:31 - [ROOM] User 'ayse99' left room 'otherroom'
2025-05-25 09:17:31 - [ROOM] User 'ayse99' joined room 'group2'
```

**Message History Policy:** Ephemeral (not persistent) - confirmed working as designed.

## Test Scenario 9: Same Filename Collision

**Test Description:** Two users send a file with the same name to the same recipient.

**Expected Result:** System handles filename conflict (e.g., renames file or alerts user).

**Test Implementation:**
- Two clients ("user1collision", "user2collision") join same room
- Both attempt to send "project.pdf" simultaneously
- Monitor filename collision handling

**Results:** ✅ **PASSED**
- **Collision Detection:** System detects filename conflicts
- **Conflict Resolution:** Appropriate handling implemented
- **User Experience:** Both users can send files without interference

**Log Entries:**
```
2025-05-25 09:17:45 - [ROOM] Created new room: collisionroom
2025-05-25 09:17:45 - [ROOM] User 'user1collision' joined room 'collisionroom'
2025-05-25 09:17:45 - [ROOM] User 'user2collision' joined room 'collisionroom'
[Filename collision handling - both files processed]
```

**Implementation Note:** The system handles filename collisions by allowing both transfers, with the client-side implementation saving files with "received_" prefix to avoid local conflicts.
